# API
application programming interface   
a set of commands, functions, protocols, and objects that programmers
can use to create software or interact with an external system. 

Such as pulling live data.  

Your program makes a request and API makes sure your request is 
to a response from the external source. 

API Endpoint: need to know the location where to get the response from.
Often a URL.

API request: you have to specify what you want and if this is allowed.

The get function in python does not give you clear data. You have to
handle it first.

Response code:  
1XX : Hold on   
2XX : Here you go   
3XX : Go Away, no permission   
4XX : You screwed up (404: this doesn't exist)  
5XX : the server screwed up 

API Parameters ask for more specific information.
