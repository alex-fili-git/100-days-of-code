# functions with output
Returning  single value
def my_function():
    result = 3*2
    return result

To capture the result of a function and not directly print it like before.

An early return will escape the function

## docstrings
add little bit of documentation to explain what a function does
Returning  single value
def my_function():
    """Here is the docstring. Example: Take first and lastname and format it."""
    result = 3*2
    return result

recursion happens if function is called in own function
