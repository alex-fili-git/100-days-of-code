# Debugging
using a debugger such as https://pythontutor.com/render.html#mode=display
to visualize what the computer is doing.
Using a breakpoint you can view what happened during the code

## in case of emergency
- take a break
- ask a friend with a fresh view
- run often, don't wait for a lot of code, preferably after each alteration
