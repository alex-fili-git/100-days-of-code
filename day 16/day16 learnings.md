# Object Oriented Programming
To structure the logic code. Procedural programming is if all code is written in one code file and is handled line from line.

OOP tries to model the real world it defines what an aspect has and what it does
has : what variables has it responsible for --> attributes -> variable attached to a object
does : what functions does it operate --> methods -> function that a particular object can do, not free floating

Classes
a waiter is a class, this is the blueprint for an object: what should it include. All attributes plus its functions.

Objects
an object is created from a class, can generate multiple objects, as many as we wish. 

car = CarBlueprint() -> 'CarBlueprint' class, car is name for the object
car.speed from car get the speed attribute from object car
car.stop() run method on object
